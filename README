##  Q U I Z  B O T ! !
##
## This program is a perl script which connects to an IRC
## server and hosts a game of trivia. It has many neat
## features including polls, online editing of questions, 
## problem question flagging and review, and several question
## variations such as "shotgun" to keep things interesting.

INSTALLATION:

Things are still a little rough, this being the bots first public 
release, but we think this will get you started. Please DO NOT
contact Ed Halley for support, as he nolonger maintains this code.
Use the source forge tools, or join us in #cyber on irc.afternet.org.

1.  Unpack -- ok, tar -xzf filename.tgz, but were assuming you did
this already or how could you read this file :)

2. Edit QuizBot.pl and customize the bots name, channel and details.
The top of the file has comments to help you.

3. Copy the example runtime files from the example/ subdirectory and
rename them to yourbotsname instead of triviabot, if you changed the
name to something else. These provide some example questions
and users to get you started. They are binary, so if you need to edit
them you must use a good editor that wont trample the dilineator it uses
(i use vim.)
   - Edit triviabot.players.txt and change the owner line to your nick,
     mask and password.

4. Start up the bot, auth as owner (/msg bot auth password), and begin 
adding questions etc. Their is nill for documentation besides online 
help at this point, so refer to the source if necessary.

BUGS:

  * This bot is quite usable for gamplay, and runs in 2 or 3 channels we
  know of, however some things are broken at this time: 
     - Review of flagged questions seems to be flakey.
     - Shotgun mode sometimes causes questions not to display.
     - lots of users asking for help at once delays the game.
